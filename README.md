We are building an admin app that allows a store owner to login to the app and manage books and authors.

## About the User
- The ideal hypothetical user of this application would be for an online store owner
- This app was for educational purposes in teaching javascript concepts on planning, ERD, FIGMA, Promises and CRUD

## Features
- Several sections for books, books on sale, authors, and favorite authors
- The user has the ability to filter books by all books or on sale books in addition can view by author and that author's books or favorite authors only.
- Books and authors may be edited, created, or deleted.
